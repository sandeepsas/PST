SLuggIng-Multiple-drop-off is a hybrid ridesharing algorithm that combines walking (slugging) and multiple-drop-off-ridesharing. In SLIM passengers can be dropped off at intersections away from their respective final destinations, thereby dramatically expanding the search space of ridesharing paths.RSVP (Ride Sharing by Virtual Pools) is a system based on SLIM algorithm. The scheme combines in a unique way three existing mechanisms: virtual queues, slugging, and multiple-drop-off ridesharing. We evaluated this scheme on 100 random pools formed from 1.8 Million trips that originated from LaGuardia Airport in NYC. The results indicate that the trip-savings enabled by RSVP-ride-sharing are significant, e.g., about 25% of the trips are saved if about 75% of the passengers are willing to ride-share. This is true for a modest delay of 10% of the trip time, and a maximum walk of 5 minutes. Our results also indicate that walking is valuable in combination with multipledrop-off ride-sharing. For example, if passengers allow a 10-minutes walk, then the trips-reduction by ride-sharing increases from about 10% to about 30%.

Abstract:
Getting a taxi in highly congested areas (e.g. Airports, conferences) is both time consuming and expensive. Chicago Tribune reports that wait at Chicago O'Hare International airport for taxi cabs can be as long as 45 minutes [1]. In this paper we propose RSVP, a ridesharing system that uses walking and virtual pools. RSVP is aimed mainly for transportation hubs, such as airports, railway stations, etc. In these places, a steady stream of passengers arrive via some public transport mode, say train, and then depart to different destinations. We introduce a model for ride-sharing that involves walking, devise ridesharing algorithms, and evaluate them using a database that recorded real taxi trips in NYC.
